  <string name="info"><b>Intro</b>
    \nThis is <i>Battery Indicator Pro</i>, the \"pro\"
    version of the popular free app, <i>Battery Indicator</i>.
    It\'s available from the Android Market for US$0.99, but it\'s
    an open source project, which means you can download the source
    for free
    from <a href="http://www.darshancomputing.com/android/battery_indicator/">the
      project website</a>.\n

    \n<b>Summary</b>
    \n<i>Battery Indicator</i> is a small, simple application
    for the Android mobile operating system. It\'s simply a little icon
    that lives in the status bar and shows you the percentage of battery
    charge left.\n

    \n<b>Limitations</b>
    \n(<i>These are out of my control.</i>)
    \n• The app can only display what the phone tells it. Most phones report
    every 1%, but a few (notably the Motorola Droid) only report every
    10%.
    \n• There\'s no way to remove the built-in battery icon.\n

    \n<b>Features</b>
    \n• Small, simple, and easy to read.
    \n• It doesn\'t do any polling. It receives a broadcast message from the OS
    when the battery status changes, then it simply updates the icon and
    goes back to sleep. What this means is that it will take up a small
    amount of RAM, but essentially 0 CPU cycles, so it can\'t drain your
    battery.
    \n• Automatically starts when the phone boots up if it was running when the
    phone shut down.\n

    \n<b>Pro-only Features</b>
    \n• High-resolution images (on devices that support them).
    \n• Easy access to Battery Use screen (requires Android 1.6+).
    \n• Configure to use Fahrenheit or Celsius as the battery temperature unit.
    \n• Configure to always start on boot, never start on boot, or start on boot
    if the app was running on shutdown.
    \n• Configure the icon to turn red below a configurable threshold and/or turn
    green above a configurable threshold.
    \n• The satisfaction of supporting the developer.\n

    \n<b>No Warranty</b>
    \nThis software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n
    \nWhile I do my best to make sure that it works well and does not
    cause problems, I am not responsible for any damage or inconvenience
    it may cause under any circumstance.\n

    \n<b>Acknowledgments</b>
    \nMany thanks are due to Google and all of the open-source coders who made
    the Android platform and this app possible.\n

    \n<b>Translations</b>
    \nI need help translating this app to other languages.  If you would like to
    help, please send me an email.\n

    \n<b>Contact</b>
    \nIf you have questions, comments, problems, or feedback of any other sort,
    please email me at <a href="mailto:android@darshancomputing.com">android@darshancomputing.com</a>.

  <string name="pref_hint"><b>Hint:</b> Press MENU for help.</string>

  <string name="settings_overview">Overview</string>
  <string name="settings_overview_help">
    The settings are organized into three separate pages, as described
    below.  Each page has its own help page describing the settings on
    that page.  Simply press MENU->Help to get help from whatever
    settings page you are on.
  </string>

  <string name="color_settings">Colors and Themes</string>
  <string name="color_settings_summary">Control icon colors and window themes</string>
  <string name="color_settings_help">
    You can change the theme for the main window and control if and
    when the notification icon changes color.
  </string>
  <string name="time_settings">Time Settings</string>
  <string name="time_settings_summary">Control time estimates and approximations</string>
  <string name="time_settings_help">
    Here you can control when the notification switches from saying
    exactly when the phone\'s status changed (unplugged, for example)
    to stating approximately how many hours ago the change happened.\n

    \nYou can also control which estimates you want to see for the
    time remaining for USB/AC charging and light/normal/heavy/constant
    usage, and adjust the basis for these estimates.
  </string>
  <string name="other_settings">Other Settings</string>
  <string name="other_settings_summary"></string>
  <string name="other_settings_help">
    All other settings are on this page, including logging, lock
    screen, temperature unit, autostart, and more.
  </string>

  <string name="pref_cat_themes">Themes</string>
  <string name="pref_main_window_theme">Main Window Theme</string>
  <string name="pref_main_window_theme_help">
    Sets the theme for the main window.  By default, the theme will
    roughly match a standard Android dialog, like Battery Indicator
    always has.  The Full Window theme is useful if you like things
    big and easy to read.  Other themes are just for fun.
  </string>

  <string name="pref_cat_logging">Logging</string>
  <string name="pref_enable_logging">Enable Logging</string>
  <string name="pref_enable_logging_summary">Log battery state changes?</string>
  <string name="pref_enable_logging_help">
    If enabled, Battery Indicator will log battery state changes
    (e.g., the phone is unplugged or becomes fully charged).
  </string>
  <string name="pref_log_everything">Log Everything</string>
  <string name="pref_log_everything_summary">Log charge changes, too?</string>
  <string name="pref_log_everything_help">
    If enabled, Battery Indicator will also log every change in the
    charge level, as well (e.g., going from 57% to 56% or vice versa).
    Most users probably have no need for this, but you can turn it on
    if you really want to keep an eye on things.  Keep in mind that
    doing so will come with a slight performance hit.
  </string>

  <string name="pref_cat_keyguard">Lock Screen / Keyguard</string>
  <string name="pref_cat_keyguard_help">
    Android allows apps to disable and reenable what it calls the
    \"keyguard\", which you probably think of as the lock screen.
    Beyond simply disabling and reenabling it, however, there is no
    more control — I can\'t control which keys turn the screen on, for
    example.
  </string>
  <string name="pref_confirm_manual_disable">Confirm Manual Disable</string>
  <string name="pref_confirm_manual_disable_summary">Confirm when manually disabling lock screen?</string>
  <string name="pref_confirm_manual_disable_help">
    If checked, a confirmation dialog will pop up when you try to
    manually disable the lock screen.  This is primarily intended to
    prevent new users from accidentally disabling their lock screen
    without knowing it.  If you disable the lock screen with any
    regularity, you\'ll probably want to turn this off.
  </string>
  <string name="pref_finish_after_toggle_lock">Exit After Toggling</string>
  <string name="pref_finish_after_toggle_lock_summary">Exit main window immediately after dis/reenabling?</string>
  <string name="pref_finish_after_toggle_lock_help">
    If you\'re someone for whom every keystroke (or touchscreen press)
    matters, you\'ll probably want to enable this.  If your goal is to
    simply disable or reenable the lock screen and then get back to
    what you\'re doing, this keeps you from having to press the BACK
    key.  Just pull down the notification bar, press on Battery
    Indicator, and press the button to toggle the lock screen: three
    screen presses and you\'re back to what you were doing.\n

    \nFor obvious reasons, you can only enable this if the previous
    setting is disabled, and vice versa.
  </string>
  <string name="pref_auto_disable">Auto-disable Lock Screen</string>
  <string name="pref_auto_disable_summary">Disable the lock screen when charging?</string>
  <string name="pref_auto_disable_help">
    If checked, then whenever the device is plugged in, Battery
    Indicator with disable the lock screen, and whenever the device is
    unplugged, it will enable it again.
  </string>

  <string name="pref_cat_temperature_unit">Temperature Unit</string>
  <string name="pref_convert_to_fahrenheit">Convert to Fahrenheit</string>
  <string name="pref_convert_to_fahrenheit_help">
    Android reports the battery temperature in degrees Celsius.  If
    you prefer to see the battery temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,
    check this option, and the app will convert for you.
  </string>

  <string name="pref_cat_autostart">Autostart</string>
  <string name="pref_autostart_at_boot">Autostart at Boot</string>
  <string name="pref_autostart_at_boot_summary">Start Battery Indicator When Device Boots?</string>
  <string name="pref_autostart_at_boot_help">
    Controls whether Battery Indicator should start itself
    automatically when the device boots up.\n

    \nThe \"If Running on Shutdown\" option works with regard to
    whether you\'ve most recently manually started or stopped Battery
    Indicator.  So if you kill Battery Indicator through some other
    means, like a task killer, then Battery Indicator doesn\'t know
    you stopped it, and it will still start at boot up if you have it
    set to this.
  </string>

  <string name="pref_cat_charge_as_text">Textual Charge Level</string>
  <string name="pref_charge_as_text">Textual Charge Level</string>
  <string name="pref_charge_as_text_summary">Show the charge level as larger text next to icon?</string>
  <string name="pref_charge_as_text_help">
    I\'ve had a few users with poorer eyesight ask me to add this
    option, whereby the charge level is displayed as text (which is a
    bit larger and easier to read) right next to the icon when you
    pull down the notification area.  The actual icon won\'t be any
    different, so this will only help when you pull down the
    notification tray, but it\'s better than nothing, and easy enough
    to add for those that want it.\n

    \nTo save precious space, I\'ve done this in a very unglamorous
    fashion, simply plopping the number in there and carrying on. This
    turns out to be easier to read than if I included the percent
    symbol, and means that the text should all fit.  It is possible
    that if you have a particularly small device, enabling this might
    make the AM/PM at the far right not quite fit.
  </string>

  <string name="pref_cat_status_duration">Status Duration (For/Since...)</string>
  <string name="pref_status_dur_est">When to Approximate</string>
  <string name="pref_status_dur_est_summary">Start Approximating Hours Since Status Change</string>
  <string name="pref_status_dur_est_help">
    Determines when the notification switches from saying, e.g.,
    \"Unplugged Since 1:10 PM\" to saying something like \"Unplugged
    for 1 Hour\".  The first way is more accurate, because it tells
    you exactly (to the minute) when the status changed, but many
    people prefer the simpler to comprehend approximation of the
    number of elapsed hours, so they make that happen sooner than the
    default of 12 hours.

  <string name="pref_cat_color">Icon Color</string>
  <string name="pref_cat_color_help">
    In order to keep the binary package for Battery Indicator
    reasonably small, there are some limitations for the colors.  At
    the time of writing, you can have a red icon as high as 30%, an
    amber icon as high as 50%, and a green icon as low as 20%.  I
    think these are reasonable compromises that should work for 99% of
    users.\n

    \nTo give you maximum control, the colors can be turned on or off
    independently.  This means that you can have as much as a
    four-tiered color scheme, where the icon is green when it is very
    full, then grayscale, then amber, then red.  Of course, most
    people probably have the amber and green thresholds set to the
    same value, so that the icon is never grayscale.
  </string>
  <string name="pref_color_preview">Color Preview</string>
  <string name="pref_color_preview_help">
    The color preview will hopefully make it really easy to visualize
    what effect your color settings will have.\n

    sense.

    \nThe options for the red threshold include all the values (in
